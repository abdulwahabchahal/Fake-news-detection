# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a robust pipeline to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle â€” Fake and Real News Dataset
- **Files**: `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`
- **Shape after cleaning**: 38,646 rows Ã— 3 columns
- **Features**: News article `text` and its `label` (fake or real)

## ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing Steps

- Concatenated fake and real news
- Shuffled and labeled data
- Removed duplicates
- Preprocessed text:
  - Lowercased, removed special characters and numbers
  - Removed stopwords
  - Applied stemming
- Transformed text to TF-IDF vectors
